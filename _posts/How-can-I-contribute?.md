Defined here is the process at wich new features and alterations are considered and processed.

If you have general questions, new feature proposals, or change requests simply create a new Github issue.

## Issues will fall under these categories:

* **feature-request**: Please add feature X I need it for Y...
* **change-request**: X appears to be wrong or not good enough could we change it like so...
*
*

## Issues will have to following statuses

* **nothing**: It has not been formalized yet
*
* **proposal**: The problem is formalized enough and has a proposal how it could be changed or added with examples.
*

## Rules

Please split up each question into its own issue. What might appear to be combinable tends to proof to the contrary later on in the process.

Try to formulate the questions in english where possible.
