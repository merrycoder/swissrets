General questions and answers that have not found their place within the documentation yet get placed here.

**How can I declare videos**

Videos are best sent through "youtube" links within the `<urls>` section. That way publishers can decide to embed them. Other online video providers such as "vimeo" will be added in the future.

**How are promotions communicated to the publishers**

There are two tags that can be used to communicate special publisher-specific infos to the publisher. `<channels>` are time sensitive promotions that can be specified with a start and and expiration date attribute. the value usually represents some sort of slug representing the "channel" or "promotion" such as "top-promotion" or "NG-TP15". `<options>` are additional key value pairs that can be used to communicate arbitrary infos to a specific publisher.
